9. Re: Retune time for the hackRF One (Michael Ossmann)Message: 1 Date: Mon, + Subject: [Hackrf-dev] An idea! Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8" Hi everybody, I am an Ham radio and user of an HackRF One in France. I am looking for several weeks on web if everybody has developped some RF test equipements. libhackrf0. HackRF is an open source Software Defined Radio that can receive and transmit between 30 MHz and 6 GHz. HackRF has a 20 MHz bandwidth. It is a High Speed USB device powered by the USB bus. This package contains the shared library. Installed size: 51 KB. How to install: sudo apt install libhackrf0. libc6. I have a windows 10 and Kali Linux computers I would like to install the firmware and software for the hackrf. But being a noob, I am not sure how and if I installed it. I already messed up one computer installing the drivers for the hackrf and I do not want to do it again. I am also having trouble finding good links for it too. Especially Kali.
