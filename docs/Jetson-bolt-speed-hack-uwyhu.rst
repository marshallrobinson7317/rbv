 Jetson Bolt Pro Speed Hack FAIL. DSD TECH HM Master and Slave Bluetooth LE iBeacon Module Compatible with iPhone and iPad with 4 PIN Dupont Cable for Arduino. The Pins are about 1 millimeter too wide. I forced it into the Jetson female connector and it went in about 1/2 way in. Red light on the bluetooth came on.  · the updated ride jetson app - has limited the bolt to 15 mph. to unlock the jetson bolt -- you need to have an android device and download and install the version of the ride jetson app (i found it at ) -- don't worry, the website is safe. you can unlock the bolt back to its 19mph speed limit. i was also able to unlock the speed for the jetson bolt pro. . It looks like the updated Jetson Bolt app reduces the max speed to 15mph down from 18mph. I only noticed because I felt it was riding slower than normal. They don't even state this in the app update version notes! I want to go back to the older app version to get my 3mph back. Wish we can make this thing go faster.
